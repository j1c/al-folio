Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a **Ph.D. candidate** in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.

My research is in the [neurodata](https://neurodata.io) lab where I am advised by [Dr. Joshua T. Vogelstein](https://jovo.me). My work focuses on using statistical and computational techniques to help understand populations of [macroscale connectomes](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010042).
Currently, I am collaborating with Microsoft Research on the development of [graspologic](https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic), a Python package for statistical analyses of networks. My anticipated graduation date is December 2023.
